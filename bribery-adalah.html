                                            Tolong generic structurenya 
responsible institutions who have to reinforce the justice today commit corruption. This is the worst. Corruptions happen in police department, courts where judges, public prosecutors, lawyers make deals to do corruption. All of us also heard in the end of 2004, Probosutejo reported that he had bribed the Supreme Court, or called Mahkamah Agung which becomes the highest level where the justice can be obtained. Perhaps you have to try to come to the local courts and see what happen there. You will see practices of bribery and other kinds of corruption. Therefore, we can say that corruptions becomes our culture. Do you like it?
The citizens have no goodwill to fight against the corruption. They create the situations in which people ahave opportunities to do corruptions. The citizens like to break the rules because they are not disciplined. For example, in the street when they drive a car or ride motorcycle, they do not have the driving license or necessary documents. Then, they are caught by the local policemen. To avoid more difficulties, they like to bribe the officer. The officer let them go then. In other words, the citizens and officers are the same, doing corruption together. If only the people were critical, disciplined, and obey the rules, and willing to report any wrong behaviors, this country will not be number one corrupting country in the world.
Conclusion Based on the reasons, we can conclude that corruption is becoming a bad culture in Indonesia if it is not ended soon by all of us. It seems that there must be more severe penalty for the Corruptors. Do we still care about the future of this country?</a>

Well, in my opinion, corruption is common everywhere in the world, even just a matter of intensity. A survey states that Indonesia is one of the most corrupt countries. The survey made me sad, actually, because I live here in Indonesia. According to the survey, businessmen who wish to pay bribery taxes have to bribe officials. Well, the punishment for the corrupt is still far from sufficient. I think we should prevent the younger generation from having a bad mentality. I can't believe we can start from the very beginning of the school. I think everyone should be involved in efforts to eradicate corruption without abolition. I answer questions well! 1) What is the topic of the text? 2) What is the author's purpose in writing this text? 3) Who makes Indonesia one of the most? broken state based on text? 4) Underline the expression of opinion you see in text! II your opinion on the matter below and give your reasons to support your opinion. Problem: 1. Our government is fighting corruption. 2. Indonesia has more and more victims of covid-19 ​</a>

Political Corruption
Political corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.
Forms of corruption vary, but include bribery, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, patronage, graft, and embezzlement. While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking, it is not restricted to these activities.
The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or
jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions. Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually, A state of unrestrained political coruption is known as a kleptocracy, literally meaning "rule by
thieves".

#Corruption and Indonesian Culture
Corruption has happened for many years and today it becomes a bad culture in Indonesia for three reasons.
Most adult Indonesian or foreigners have known and admitted that corruptions happen in many places. The daily newspapers, news programs on TV and radio have reported corruptions are done everywhere, almost in all departments or public services of this country. Corruptions happen in health, education departments and banks. When we manage to get some documents in public service offices, we usually need much money to pay. Manipulations happen everywhere.
The actions to eliminate corruption are weak. The ever stronger culture seems not to come to an end when the responsible institutions who have to reinforce the justice today commit corruption. This is the worst. Corruptions happen in police department, courts where judges, public prosecutors, lawyers make deals to do corruption. All of us also heard in the end of 2004, Probosutejo reported that he had bribed the Supreme Court, or called Mahkamah Agung which becomes the highest level where the justice can be obtained. Perhaps you have to try to come to the local courts and see what happen there. You will see practices of bribery and other kinds of corruption. Therefore, we can say that corruptions becomes our culture. Do you like it?
The citizens have no goodwill to fight against the corruption. They create the situations in which people ahave opportunities to do corruptions. The citizens like to break the rules because they are not disciplined. For example, in the street when they drive a car or ride motorcycle, they do not have the driving license or necessary documents. Then, they are caught by the local policemen. To avoid more difficulties, they like to bribe the officer. The officer let them go then. In other words, the citizens and officers are the same, doing corruption together. If only the people were critical, disciplined, and obey the rules, and willing to report any wrong behaviors, this country will not be number one corrupting country in the world.
Conclusion Based on the reasons, we can conclude that corruption is becoming a bad culture in Indonesia if it is not ended soon by all of us. It seems that there must be more severe penalty for the Corruptors. Do we still care about the future of this country?
#The Dangerous of Using Drugs
Everybody must pay attention of drugs. Drugs are very dangerous for us. Why it is very dangerous for us? Because its can caused harm to our body.
In terms of health, many organs in our body can be harm because using drug. In general, the impact of using drug are can unconscious, make us hallucinate, can harm our nerve, and cause addictive effect. Beside that, using drugs can make the users depressed, liver disease, schizophrenia, blockage of blood vessels, dehydration, optic nerve damage, brain damage, and finally it can cause DEATH!
When viewed in terms of Islamic law, drugs are forbidden. Because it is cause badness, self harm, debilitate. And Islam proscribes all that can cause badness, self harm because it is included zhalim. Also if we using drugs, it means we already do the forbidden things in Islam, it means we sin. So, in terms of Islamic law, using drugs also dangerous.
Furthermore, if the users of drugs are teenagers, it can endanger their future, and endanger their homeland, their country. From the data, 32 percent of drugs users in Indonesia are teenagers, so, if many teenagers –in this case Indonesia- use drugs, it can be endanger this country, harm youth generation, whereas youths are nation expectation. If the youth using drugs, our nation can be destroy!
So, from now on we must pay attention of drugs, because it’s very dangerous, both in terms of health, religion (Islam), nationality and state.</a>

                                            Corruption has happened for many years and today it becomes a bad culture in Indonesia for three reasons. Most adult Indonesian or foreigners have known and admitted that corruptions happen in many placen, The daily newspapers, news programs on TV and radio have reported corruptions are done everywhere, almost in all departments or public services of this country. Corruptions happen in health, education departments and banks. When we manage to get some documents in public service offices, we usually need much money to pay. Manipulations happen everywhere. - The actions to eliminate corruption are weak. The ever stronger culture seems not to come to an snu when the responsible institutions who have to reinforce the justice today commit corruption This is the worst. Corruptions happen in police department, courts where judges, public prosecutors, lawyers make deals to do corruption. All of us also heard in the end of 2004, Probosutejo reported that he had bribed the Supreme Court, or called Mahkamah Agung which becomes the highest level where the justice can be obtained. Perhaps you have to try to come to the local courts and see what happen there. You will see practices of bribery and other kinds of corruption. Therefore, we can say that corruptions becomes our culture. Do you like it?The citizens have no goodwill to fight against the corruption. They create the situations in which people have opportunities to do corruptions. The citizens like to break the rules because they are not disciplined. For example, in the street when they drive a car or ride motorcycle, they do not have the driving license or necessary documents. Then, they are caught by the local policemen. To avoid more difficulties, they like to bribe the officer. The officer let them go then. In other words, the citizens and officers are the same, doing together. If only the people were critical, disciplined, and obey the rules, and willing to report any coru wrong behaviors, this country will not be number one corrupting country in the world. Conclusion Based on the reasons, we can conclude that corruption is becoming a bad culture in Indonesia if it is not ended soon by all of us. It seems that there must be more severe penalty for the Corruptors. Do we still care about the future of this country?1.why does the writer think that corruption is difficult to be banished from Indonesian?2.Why does the writer think that the citizen do nothing in fighting the corruption?3.what must government dfo to fight the corruption?4.what is the function of the text above?5.what do you think is the best argument from the text above?tolong bantu jawab ​</a>

                        Bribery dan extortion punya banyak kesamaan, dan sangat mudah untuk menyalahartikan bribery sebagai extortion dan sebaliknya.<br /><br />Perbedaan mendasar adalah hubungan antara pemberi dan penerima barang, jasa, atau uang. Pada extortion, penerima, bukan pemberi, adalah inisiator/penggagas dari transaksi. Pada bribery, penerima atau penerima bisa saja jadi penggagas. Bedanya, pada extortion penerima tidak memberi imbalan apa-apa (berupa jasa/servis/perlakuan istimewa, dll) kepada pemberi. Penerima malah mengancam akan mengancam melakukan hal yang merugikan pemberi jika keinginan mereka tidak dipenuhi, lebih mirip ke arah pemerasan.<br />

responsible institutions who have to reinforce the justice today commit corruption. This is the worst. Corruptions happen in police department, courts where judges, public prosecutors, lawyers make deals to do corruption. All of us also heard in the end of 2004, Probosutejo reported that he had bribed the Supreme Court, or called Mahkamah Agung which becomes the highest level where the justice can be obtained. Perhaps you have to try to come to the local courts and see what happen there. You will see practices of bribery and other kinds of corruption. Therefore, we can say that corruptions becomes our culture. Do you like it?
The citizens have no goodwill to fight against the corruption. They create the situations in which people ahave opportunities to do corruptions. The citizens like to break the rules because they are not disciplined. For example, in the street when they drive a car or ride motorcycle, they do not have the driving license or necessary documents. Then, they are caught by the local policemen. To avoid more difficulties, they like to bribe the officer. The officer let them go then. In other words, the citizens and officers are the same, doing corruption together. If only the people were critical, disciplined, and obey the rules, and willing to report any wrong behaviors, this country will not be number one corrupting country in the world.
Conclusion Based on the reasons, we can conclude that corruption is becoming a bad culture in Indonesia if it is not ended soon by all of us. It seems that there must be more severe penalty for the Corruptors. Do we still care about the future of this country?</h2><br />

Well, in my opinion, corruption is common everywhere in the world, even just a matter of intensity. A survey states that Indonesia is one of the most corrupt countries. The survey made me sad, actually, because I live here in Indonesia. According to the survey, businessmen who wish to pay bribery taxes have to bribe officials. Well, the punishment for the corrupt is still far from sufficient. I think we should prevent the younger generation from having a bad mentality. I can't believe we can start from the very beginning of the school. I think everyone should be involved in efforts to eradicate corruption without abolition.

                            10. Apa tanggapan dari kata Kejahatan korupsi dapat berupa pemberian suap (bribery) penggelapan dana-dana publik (emblezzment of public funds), penyalahgunaan wewenang dan pengaruh (trading in influence), penyembunyuan(concelment) dan pencucian (laundering) hasil hasil korupsi (proceeds of coruption) pencucian uang (money laundering) dan memperkaya diri sendiri secara tidak sah (illicit enrichment)?</h2><br />
                        Definisi arti kata SUAP (bribery) bermula dari asal kata briberie (Perancis) yang artinya adalah’begging’ (mengemis) atau ’vagrancy’ (penggelandangan). Dalam bahasa Latin disebut briba, yang artinya ’a piece of bread given to beggar’ (sepotong roti yang diberikan kepada pengemis). Dalam perkembangannya bribe bermakna ’sedekah’ (alms), ’blackmail’, atau ’extortion’ (pemerasan) dalam kaitannya dengan ’gifts received or given in order to influence corruptly’ (pemberian atau hadiah yang diterima atau diberikan dengan maksud untuk memengaruhi secara jahat atau korup).<br /><br /><br />Suap-menyuap yang dilakukan secara bersama- sama dengan penggelapan dana-dana publik (embezzlement of public funds) sering disebut sebagai inti atau bentuk dasar dari tindak pidana korupsi. Korupsi sendiri secara universal diartikan sebagai bejat moral, perbuatan yang tidak wajar, atau noda (depravity, perversion, or taint); suatu perusakan integritas, kebajikan, atau asas-asas moral (an impairment of integrity, virtue, or moral principles).<br /><br /><br />Akibat adanya suap-menyuap menimbulkan ancaman terhadap stabilitas ekonomi; dapat merusak lembaga dan nilai-nilai demokrasi, nilai-nilai etika, dan keadilan; bersifat diskriminatif dan merongrong etika dan kompetisi bisnis yang jujur; mencederai pembangunan berkelanjutan dan tegaknya hukum.<br /><br />Kriminalisasi terhadap tindak pidana korupsi, termasuk suap-menyuap, mempunyai alasan yang sangat kuat sebab kejahatan tersebut tidak lagi dipandang sebagai kejahatan konvensional, melainkan sebagai kejahatan luar biasa (extraordinary crime), karena karakter korupsi yang sangat kriminogin (dapat menjadi sumber kejahatan lain) dan viktimogin (secara potensial dapat merugikan pelbagai dimensi kepentingan).<br /><br /><br />Kriminalisasi terhadap tindak pidana suap secara mendasar sudah dilakukan melalui Pasal 209 KUHP yang mengatur penyuapan aktif (actieve omkooping atau active bribery) terhadap pegawai negeri. Pasangan dari pasal ini adalah Pasal 419 KUHP yang mengatur tentang penyuapan pasif (passive omkooping atau passive bribery), yang mengancam pidana terhadap pegawai negeri yang menerima hadiah atau janji tersebut di atas.<br /><br /><br />Selanjutnya Pasal 210 KUHP yang mengatur penyuapan terhadap hakim dan penasihat di pengadilan. Hakim dan penasihat yang menerima suap tersebut diancam pidana oleh Pasal 420 KUHP.Keempat pasal tersebut kemudian dinyatakan Perluasan tindak pidana suap dalam bentuk retour-commissie atau gratifikasi diatur dalam Pasal 418 KUHP sebagai tindak pidana korupsi melalui UU No 31 Tahun 1999 jo UU No 20 Tahun 2001.<br /><br /><br />Suap yang menyangkut kepentingan umum (baik aktif maupun pasif) dikriminalisasikan melalui UU No 11 Tahun 1980.<br /><br />Tindak pidana suap ini diatur dalam, UU No. 11 Tahun 1980 tentang Tindak Pidana Suap (“UU 3/1980”). Pasal 3 UU 3/1980<br /><br />0<br />

Political Corruption
Political corruption is the use of legislated powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.
Forms of corruption vary, but include bribery, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, patronage, graft, and embezzlement. While corruption may facilitate criminal enterprise such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and human trafficking, it is not restricted to these activities.
The activities that constitute illegal corruption differ depending on the country or
jurisdiction. For instance, certain political funding practices that are legal in one place may be illegal in another. In some cases, government officials have broad or poorly defined powers, which make it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal actions. Worldwide, bribery alone is estimated to involve over 1 trillion US dollars annually, A state of unrestrained political coruption is known as a kleptocracy, literally meaning "rule by
thieves".

#Corruption and Indonesian Culture
Corruption has happened for many years and today it becomes a bad culture in Indonesia for three reasons.
Most adult Indonesian or foreigners have known and admitted that corruptions happen in many places. The daily newspapers, news programs on TV and radio have reported corruptions are done everywhere, almost in all departments or public services of this country. Corruptions happen in health, education departments and banks. When we manage to get some documents in public service offices, we usually need much money to pay. Manipulations happen everywhere.
The actions to eliminate corruption are weak. The ever stronger culture seems not to come to an end when the responsible institutions who have to reinforce the justice today commit corruption. This is the worst. Corruptions happen in police department, courts where judges, public prosecutors, lawyers make deals to do corruption. All of us also heard in the end of 2004, Probosutejo reported that he had bribed the Supreme Court, or called Mahkamah Agung which becomes the highest level where the justice can be obtained. Perhaps you have to try to come to the local courts and see what happen there. You will see practices of bribery and other kinds of corruption. Therefore, we can say that corruptions becomes our culture. Do you like it?
The citizens have no goodwill to fight against the corruption. They create the situations in which people ahave opportunities to do corruptions. The citizens like to break the rules because they are not disciplined. For example, in the street when they drive a car or ride motorcycle, they do not have the driving license or necessary documents. Then, they are caught by the local policemen. To avoid more difficulties, they like to bribe the officer. The officer let them go then. In other words, the citizens and officers are the same, doing corruption together. If only the people were critical, disciplined, and obey the rules, and willing to report any wrong behaviors, this country will not be number one corrupting country in the world.
Conclusion Based on the reasons, we can conclude that corruption is becoming a bad culture in Indonesia if it is not ended soon by all of us. It seems that there must be more severe penalty for the Corruptors. Do we still care about the future of this country?
#The Dangerous of Using Drugs
Everybody must pay attention of drugs. Drugs are very dangerous for us. Why it is very dangerous for us? Because its can caused harm to our body.
In terms of health, many organs in our body can be harm because using drug. In general, the impact of using drug are can unconscious, make us hallucinate, can harm our nerve, and cause addictive effect. Beside that, using drugs can make the users depressed, liver disease, schizophrenia, blockage of blood vessels, dehydration, optic nerve damage, brain damage, and finally it can cause DEATH!
When viewed in terms of Islamic law, drugs are forbidden. Because it is cause badness, self harm, debilitate. And Islam proscribes all that can cause badness, self harm because it is included zhalim. Also if we using drugs, it means we already do the forbidden things in Islam, it means we sin. So, in terms of Islamic law, using drugs also dangerous.
Furthermore, if the users of drugs are teenagers, it can endanger their future, and endanger their homeland, their country. From the data, 32 percent of drugs users in Indonesia are teenagers, so, if many teenagers –in this case Indonesia- use drugs, it can be endanger this country, harm youth generation, whereas youths are nation expectation. If the youth using drugs, our nation can be destroy!
So, from now on we must pay attention of drugs, because it’s very dangerous, both in terms of health, religion (Islam), nationality and state.</h2><br />

Then, they are caught by the local policemen. To avoid more difficulties, theylike to bribe the officer. The officer let them go then.

CORRUPTION AND INDONESIAN CULTURECorruption has happened for many years and today it becomes a bad culture in Indonesia for some reasons.Most adult Indonesia or foreigners have known and admitted that corruptions happen in many places. The daily newspapers, news program on TV and radio have reported corruptions are done everywhere, almost in all department or public services of this country. Corruptions happen in health, education department, and banks. When we manage to get some documents in public service offices, we usually need much money to pay.

Corruption happened in police department, court where judges, public prosecutors, lawyers make deals to do corruption. All of us also heard in the end of 2004 Probosutedjo reported that he had bribe the Supreme Court, or called Mahkamah Agung which becomes the highest level where the justice can be obtained. Perhaps you have to try to come to the local courts and see what happen there. You will see practices of bribery and other kinds of corruption. Therefore, we can say that corruptions become our culture. Do you like it?The citizens have no goodwill to fight against the corruption. They create the situations in which people have opportunities to do corruptions. The citizens like to break the rules because they are not disciplined. For example, in the street when they drive a car or ride motorcycle, they do not have driving license or necessary documents. Then, they are caught by local policeman.

If only the people were critical, disciplined, and obey the rules, and willing to report any wrong behaviors, this country will not be number one corrupting country in the world.Based on the reasons, we can conclude that corruption is becoming a bad culture in Indonesia. Corruptions happen in every department and every sector of public services. The actions to eliminate corruption are weak, while in other hand the officers love to be bribed.

The following text is for question 6 to 9.
Corruption has happened for many years and it becomes a bad culture in Indonesia. The corruption in Indonesia happen in many places. There had been reported thar corruption is done in almost everywhere, in public Service like community services, health, and eve education department. 
   The actions to eliminate corruption are weak. This corruption culture seems not coming to an end when the institutions responsible for reinforcing the justice also commit corruption. This is the worst. Corruption happen in police department, and also in courts where judges,public prosecutors, and lawyears make deals to do corruption.

</p><p>    An analytical exposition is a type of spoken or written text that is intended to persuade the listeners or readers that something is the case. To make the persuasion stronger, the speaker or writer gives some arguments as the fundamental reasons why something is the case.

</p><p>    Corruption and Indonesian Culture
</p><p>
</p><p>    Thesis:
</p><p>    Corruption has happened for many years and today it becomes a bad culture in Indonesia for three reasons.
</p><p>
</p><p>    Argument 1:
</p><p>    Most adult Indonesian or foreigners have known and admitted that corruptions happen in many places. The daily newspapers, news programs on TV and radio have reported corruptions are done everywhere, almost in all departments or public services of this country. Corruptions happen in health, education departments and banks. When we manage to get somedocuments in public service offices, we usually need much money to pay. Manipulations happen everywhere.
</p><p>
</p><p>    Argument 2:
</p><p>    The actions to eliminate corruption are weak. The ever stronger culture seems not to come to an
</p><p>    end when the responsible institutions who have to reinforce the justice today commit corruption. This is the worst. Corruptions happen in police department, courts where judges, public prosecutors, lawyers make deals to do corruption. All of us also heard in the end of 2004, Probosutejo reported that he had bribed the Supreme Court, or called Mahkamah Agung which becomes the highest level where the justice can be obtained. Perhaps you have to try to come to the local courts and see what happen there. You will see practices of bribery and other kinds of corruption. Therefore, we can say that corruptions becomes our culture. Do you like it?
</p><p>
</p><p>    Argument 3:
</p><p>    The citizens have no goodwill to fight against the corruption. They create the situations in which people have opportunities to do corruptions. The citizens like to break the rules because they are not disciplined. For example, in the street when they drive a car or ride motorcycle, they do not have the driving license or necessary documents. Then, they are caught by the local policemen. To avoid more difficulties, they like to bribe the officer. The officer let them go then. In other words, the citizens and officers are the same, doing corruption together. If only the people were critical, disciplined, and obey the rules, and willing to report any wrong behaviors, this country will not be number one corrupting country in the world.
</p><p>
</p><p>    Reiteration/ conclusion:
</p><p>    In conclusion, corruption is becoming a bad culture in Indonesia if it is not ended soon by all of us. It seems that there must be more severe penalty for the corruptors. Do we still care about the future of this country?
