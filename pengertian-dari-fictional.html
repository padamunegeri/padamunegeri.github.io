                                            The Hobbit is a film series consisting of three epic fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, which expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material and characters written especially for the films. The films are subtitled An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).&lt;br /&gt;The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur, and the pursuit of Azog and Bolg, who seek vengeance against Thorin and his ancestors.&lt;br /&gt;The first film in the series premiered at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington, New Zealand on 28 November 2012. One hundred thousand people lined the red carpet on Courtenay Place, and the entire event was broadcast live on television in New Zealand and streamed over the Internet. The second film of the series premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on 2 December 2013. The third and final film premiered at Leicester Square in London on 1 December 2014. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; TOLONG BUATKAN 5 INFORMASI TENTANG TEKS DI ATAS​</a>

General classification : " Television, or Tv, is one of humanity's most important means of communication. it brings pictures and sounds from around the world into millions of homes.
Description: " People with a Tv set can sit in their house and watch the president makes a speech or visits a foreign country. They can see a war being fought, and they can watch government leaders try to bring about peace. Through tv, viewers at home can see and learn about people, places and things in faraway lands. Tv even takes viewers out of this world as the astronauts explore outer space.
    In addition to all these things, tv brings its viewers a steady stream of programmed that are designed to entertain. In fact, Tv provides many more entertainment programmes than any other kind of information media. The programmes include action-packed dramas, light comedies, soap operas, sports events, cartoons, quizzes, variety shows and motion pictures.

                                            ANCIENT AEGEAN ARCHITECTURE. Before the dawn of An-
cient Greece, a vibrant Neolithic and then Bronze Age society thrived
in several different cultures found along the Aegean Sea. The Aegean
is home to many clusters of islands, and the earliest known Aegean
culture, established around 6000 BC, was centered on several of the
Cycladic Islands off the southeast coast of Greece. Today these is-
lands appear to be quite barren, rocky outposts with few trees, but by
around 3000 BC they were home to a thriving culture of farmers and
seafaring traders, and their inhabitants began to use local stone to
create not only the famous Cycladic figurines of musicians, but also
fortified towns and burial mounds. Several of these islands have
quarries of the beautiful white marble that later became the preferred
building material in Ancient Greece. To date, however, no habitations
have been excavated on these islands. 
Also from around 3000 BC, another Bronze Age culture thrived on
the much larger island of Crete, located in the southern area of the
Aegean, and this island culture developed into what was later called
the Minoan civilization. Minoan peoples are named after their leg-
endary ruler, King Minos, who is described in Homer’s epic tales as
ruling from his labyrinth-like palace in the ancient city of Knossos.
This palace, dating from 1900 BC to around 1100 BC, was discov-
ered by the archaeologists Heinrich Schliemann, who located the site,
and then Arthur Evans, who subsequently discovered and excavated
the area. Both scholars argued that Homer’s tales were not entirely
fictional, but could be used to unearth pre-Homeric cities such as the
ancient site of Troy in Turkey and the Peloponnesian city of the an-
cient ruling family of Atreus, known as Mycenae.
Minoan peoples farmed and maintained herds of animals, but they
also fished for food and established vast trade routes across the
Aegean and the Mediterranean. This thriving culture is also known
for its own system of writing, which was needed in order to keep</a>

                                            TelevisionTelevision, or TV, is one of humanity's most important means of communication. It brings pictures and sounds from around the world into millions of homes.People with a television set can sit in their house and watch the president makes a speech or visits a foreign country. They can see a war being fought, and they can wacth government leaders try to bring about peace. Through television, viewers at home can see and learn about peopl, places, and things in a away lands. Television even takes viewers out of this world as the astronauts explore outer space.In addition to all these things, television brings its viewers a steady stream of programmes that are designed to entertain. In fact, TV provides many more entertainment programmes than any other kind of information media. The programmes include action-packed dramas, light comedies, soap operas, sports events, cartoons, quizzes, variety shows and motion pictures.More than 83 million homes in the United States - or 98% of all the country's homes - have at least one television set. On the average, a television set is in use in each home for about 6 3/4 hours each day. As a result, television has an important influence on how people spend their time, as well as on what they see and learn. After they arrive from work, they usually watch TV. Then, the importance of television is proven.question1.is the text about something factual or fictional?what is it?2.is there a television in yout home?3.what program can get from the television?4.on the everage,how long are you standing by in front of the television?5.what programs do you like?6.in your mind,are there any advan tages and disadvantages of television?7.how can television have importaint influenles to reople?</a>

                                            Paul Bunyan is perhaps America’s best-known folk hero. A fictional logger of incredible strength, he was most likely based on an actual nineteenth-century logger from the northern United States or Canada. As a folk hero, he struck a chord with Americans on some level, perhaps because he was incredibly strong but also because he was hard-working and capable, ingenious in solving problems, and fun-loving.  Though there is evidence that Paul Bunyan tales were part of oral tradition in the nineteenth century, Paul Bunyan stories did not appear in written form until the early twentieth century. Journalist James McGillivray included descriptions of Bunyan in a series of essays entitled "The Round River Drive," which appeared in a number of Midwestern newspapers between 1906 and 1910.  However, it was through an extensive advertising campaign that Paul Bunyan moved solidly into print.  Recognizing the appeal of Paul Bunyan as a figure for his company’s advertising, William Laughead, an advertising executive for the Red River Lumber Company, initiated a campaign that consisted of a series of publications featuring Paul Bunyan. For several decades, the company distributed these publications free of charge and made no attempt to obtain a copyright on them. In fact, the company vigorously encouraged other writers to make use of Paul Bunyan because it felt that the use of this character enhanced the name recognition of the Red River Lumber Company inasmuch as the name of the folk hero and the name of the company had become interwoven.  The Bunyan stories published by Red River and further circulated by others were tall tales of gigantic proportions. In these tales, Bunyan is depicted as a man of superhuman proportions, who is strong, hard-working, entrepreneurial, and innovative. In one story, for example, Paul is credited with digging the Great Lakes in order to create a watering hole for his giant ox, Babe. In another of these tales, Paul caused an entire winter of blue snow to fall by swearing a blue streak after he injured himself by smashing his thumb with a large hammer. A third story in the series describes Paul’s role in establishing the Mississippi River.  Fascination with Paul Bunyan has continued to grow, and today he is a standard of American folklore. The prevalence of Bunyan as a figure of folklore today is evidenced by references to him in countless stories, cartoons, poems, and songs as well as the numerous community festivals and logging competitions featuring Paul Bunyan that can be found throughout the sections of the country where logging has a strong tradition.

                                            Social media has come a long way in recent years. From 2006 onwards, the growth rate was unexpectedly high. As technology grows, despite its drawbacks, it is clear that more and more people will benefit from using social media. Here are some reasons why social media brings many benefits to society.The first and foremost advantage of social media is connectivity. People from anywhere can connect with anyone, regardless of location and religion. The beauty of social media is that you can connect with itanyone to learn and share your thoughts.Besides, social media has a lot of benefits for students and teachers. It's very easy to educate from other experts and professionals via social media. You can follow anyone to learn from it and increase your knowledge of any field. Regardless of your location and educational background, you caneducate yourself, without paying for it.Then, another advantage of the social media is that you can update yourself from the latest happenings around the world. With the help of social media, you can get the facts and true information by doing someresearch. However, we should be wise in receiving messages. In a few cases, messages we receivea are biased.Since our word has different religions and beliefs, social media helps in buiding and participating in the community of own religion and believes. Similarly, people of different communities can connect to discuss and share related items. For example, game lovers can join games-related communiues, car lovers can join communities related to cars, and so on.Last but not least, whether you have an offline or online business, you can promote your business to the largest audience. The whole word is open for you, to promote your business. This makes the business profitable and less expensive, because most of the expenses made over a business are for advertising and promotion. This can be decreased by constantly and regularly involving on the social media to connect with the right audience.Based on the arguments above, I believe that social media is beneficial for our lives. Howevey weshould be wise when using social media.Question:1. Is the text fictional or non-fiction? Explain the reason.2. Why is the text written?3. What tense is mostly used in the text4.

ANCIENT AEGEAN ARCHITECTURE. Before the dawn of An-
cient Greece, a vibrant Neolithic and then Bronze Age society thrived
in several different cultures found along the Aegean Sea. The Aegean
is home to many clusters of islands, and the earliest known Aegean
culture, established around 6000 BC, was centered on several of the
Cycladic Islands off the southeast coast of Greece. Today these is-
lands appear to be quite barren, rocky outposts with few trees, but by
around 3000 BC they were home to a thriving culture of farmers and
seafaring traders, and their inhabitants began to use local stone to
create not only the famous Cycladic figurines of musicians, but also
fortified towns and burial mounds. Several of these islands have
quarries of the beautiful white marble that later became the preferred
building material in Ancient Greece. To date, however, no habitations
have been excavated on these islands. 
Also from around 3000 BC, another Bronze Age culture thrived on
the much larger island of Crete, located in the southern area of the
Aegean, and this island culture developed into what was later called
the Minoan civilization. Minoan peoples are named after their leg-
endary ruler, King Minos, who is described in Homer’s epic tales as
ruling from his labyrinth-like palace in the ancient city of Knossos.
This palace, dating from 1900 BC to around 1100 BC, was discov-
ered by the archaeologists Heinrich Schliemann, who located the site,
and then Arthur Evans, who subsequently discovered and excavated
the area. Both scholars argued that Homer’s tales were not entirely
fictional, but could be used to unearth pre-Homeric cities such as the
ancient site of Troy in Turkey and the Peloponnesian city of the an-
cient ruling family of Atreus, known as Mycenae.
Minoan peoples farmed and maintained herds of animals, but they
also fished for food and established vast trade routes across the
Aegean and the Mediterranean. This thriving culture is also known
for its own system of writing, which was needed in order to keep</a>

When robots are virtual software agents,they are usually referred to as bots.The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanold in a1920 play R.U.R. by the Czech writer, Karel Čapek but it was Karel'sbrother Josef Čapek who was the word's true Inventor. In an articlein the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933, he explained that he hadoriginally wanted to call the creatures featured in the play labori("workers", from Latin labor). However, he did not like the word,and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested "roboti".The word robota means literally "corvée", "serf labor", andfiguratively "drudgery" or "hard work" in Czech and also (moregeneral) "work", "labor" in many Slavic languages:In general robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and arenow used in different fields. They have replaced humans inperforming repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefernot to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations or whichtake place in extreme environments such as outer space or thebottom of the sea. For instance, robots can now be used in industry,as in car manufacturing, or they can be used in homes to do thehousework. Some robots may respond to speech or be evenmedical operating tools.bups www memelishgan.com​</a>

                                            The Hobbit is a film series consisting of three epic fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, which expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material and characters written especially for the films. The films are subtitled An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).
The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur, and the pursuit of Azog and Bolg, who seek vengeance against Thorin and his ancestors.
The first film in the series premiered at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington, New Zealand on 28 November 2012. One hundred thousand people lined the red carpet on Courtenay Place, and the entire event was broadcast live on television in New Zealand and streamed over the Internet. The second film of the series premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on 2 December 2013. The third and final film premiered at Leicester Square in London on 1 December 2014.

                                            SNAKES Snakes are reptiles. They belong to the same group as lizards but form a sub group of their own. Snakes are not slimy. They are covered in scales which are just bumps on the skin. Their skin is hard and glossy to reduce friction as the snake slithers along the ground. Snakes often sun bake on the rocks in the warm weather. This is because snakes are cold blooded and they need the sun's warmth to heat their body up. Most snakes live in the country. Some type of snakes live in trees, some live in water but most live on the ground deserted rabbit burrows, in thick, long grass and in old logs. A snake's diet usually consists of frogs, lizards and mice and other snakes. The Anaconda can eat small crocodiles and even wild boars. Answer the questions! 1. What is the text about? 2.

                                            tolong terjemahkan ke bahasa indonesia AUTHOR-ORIENTED APPROACHESIn the nineteenth century, before the major formalist-structuralisttheories of the twentieth century, biographical criticism evolvedand became a dominant movement. This author-orientedapproach established a direct link between the literary text and thebiography of the author. Dates, facts, and events in an author’s life arejuxtaposed with literary elements of his or her works in order to findaspects which connect the biography of the author with the text.Research into the milieu and education of the author is conducted andthen related to certain phenomena in the text. In addition, an author’slibrary can be examined in order to gain insight into the author’sbackground reading orlettersand diaries may be consulted for personalreflections. Autobiographies are obviously suitable for this kind of approach,which compares the fictional portrayal with the facts and figures fromthe author’s life. In many cases, autobiographical material enters thefictional text in codes. The American playwright Eugene O’Neill, forexample, used veiled autobiographical elements in his play Long Day’sJourney into Night (c. 1941; published 1956). Although the charactersand events in the play are supposedly fictional, they are based on realpeople and dramatize events from his family life.Author-centered approaches focus also on aspects which mighthave entered the text on a subconscious or involuntary level. The factthat Mary Shelley had a miscarriage during the period in which shewrote her novel Frankenstein (1818) can be related directly to the plot.According to the author-centered approaches, the central theme ofthe novel, the creation of an artificial human being, can be traced backto Mary Shelley’s intense psychological occupation with the issue ofbirth at the time. Many authors wish to keep their texts fictional andtheir private spheres intact and hence oppose these approaches. Forexample, the American author J.D.Salinger, who became famous withthe publication of his novel The Catcher in the Rye, has strictly refusedto make public any information about his private life over the lastdecades.Canonical authors in particular—those who are highly regarded inliterary criticism, like Shakespeare, Milton, or Joyce—often tend tobe mythologized. This leads to attempts to reconstruct the author’sspirit through his work. Phenomenological approaches assume thatthe author is present in his text in encoded form and that his spirit canbe revived by an intensive reading of his complete works.As the example from Mary Shelley’s life shows, many biographicalapproaches also tend to employ psychological explanations. This hasled to psychoanalytic literary criticism, a movement whichsometimes deals with the author, but primarily attempts to illuminategeneral psychological aspects in a text that do not necessarily relate tothe author exclusively. Under the influence of Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), psychoanalytic literary criticism expanded the study ofpsychological features beyond the author to cover a variety of intrinsictextual aspects. For instance, characters in a text can be analyzedpsychologically, as if they were real people. An example which hasoften been cited in this context is the mental state of Hamlet inShakespeare’s drama; psychoanalytic critics ask whether Hamlet ismad and, if so, from which psychological illness he is suffering. Sigmund Freud, too, borrowed from literary texts in hisexplanations of certain psychological phenomena. Some of his studies,among them the analysis of E.T.A.Hoffmann’s (1772–1822) story“The Sandman” (1817), rank among the classical interpretations ofliterary texts. In the second half of the twentieth century,psychoanalytic literary criticism regained momentum under theinfluence of the French analyst Jacques Lacan (1901–81), especially inthe Anglo-American world. The interest in psychological phenomenaindirectly abetted the spread of the so-called reader-centeredapproaches.

                            4. The Hobbit is a film series consisting of three epic fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, which expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material and characters written especially for the films. The films are subtitled An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).&lt;br /&gt;The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur, and the pursuit of Azog and Bolg, who seek vengeance against Thorin and his ancestors.&lt;br /&gt;The first film in the series premiered at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington, New Zealand on 28 November 2012. One hundred thousand people lined the red carpet on Courtenay Place, and the entire event was broadcast live on television in New Zealand and streamed over the Internet. The second film of the series premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on 2 December 2013. The third and final film premiered at Leicester Square in London on 1 December 2014. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; TOLONG BUATKAN 5 INFORMASI TENTANG TEKS DI ATAS​</h2><br />

<p>Mata Pelajaran: Sejarah </p>

<p>Materi: -</p>

<p>Kata Kunci: Jules Verne, Phileas Fogg</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Jawaban pendek:</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Phileas Fogg is a name synonymous with world adventure! He
was nota real chap, but a fictional character.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Phileas Fogg adalah nama yang sangat terkait dengan petualangan
dunia! Dia bukan orang sebenarnya, namun hanya tokoh cerita saja.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Jawaban panjang:</strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Phileas Fogg adalah tokoh utama dari novel berbahasa
Perancis “Le tour du monde en 80 jours”, atau “Berkeliling Dunia dalam 80 Hari”. karya penulis
Jules Verne, yang diterbitkan pertama kali pada tahun1873.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Novel ini bercerita tentang perjalanan Phileas Fogg, seorang
aristokrat yang dingin dan penuh percaya diri. Phileas Fogg bertaruh dengan
rekan-rekannya di Reform Club di kota London bahwa dia dapat mengelilingi dunia
dalam waktu 80 hari, bila gagal dia akan didenda £20000, jumlah yang sangat
banyak dalam waktu itu.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dari London Phileas Fogg berangkat bersama Passepartout,
seorang pelayannya asal Perancis, yang cerdik dan setia. Saat hendak menempuh
perjalanan, dia dicurigai sebagai seorang perampok yang kabur dari polisi,
sehingga dia dibuntuti terus oleh detektif polisi.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dari Inggris dia menyeberang ke Perancis, Mesir lalu India.
Di India dia menyelamatkan Aouda, sorang janda yang hendak dipaksa dibakar hidup-hidup
mengikuti suaminya.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dari India, dia menuju ke Hong Kong, Jepang, dan Amerika
Serikat. Dari Amerika Serikat, dia berusaha mengejar waktu untuk mencapai
London tepat waktu sebelum 80 hari lewat. Namun ternyata dia sampai di London
telat sehari. Dia merasa gundah dan putus asa, sampai Passepartout mengingatkan
bahwa karena mereka melewati garis penanggalan internasional, mereka sebenarnya
lebih maju 1 hari dan tepat waktu sampai kembali ke London. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Phileas Fogg akhirnya memenangi taruhannya dan hidup bahagia
bersama Aouda yang menemaninya hingga London.</p><br />

                            9. ANCIENT AEGEAN ARCHITECTURE. Before the dawn of An-
cient Greece, a vibrant Neolithic and then Bronze Age society thrived
in several different cultures found along the Aegean Sea. The Aegean
is home to many clusters of islands, and the earliest known Aegean
culture, established around 6000 BC, was centered on several of the
Cycladic Islands off the southeast coast of Greece. Today these is-
lands appear to be quite barren, rocky outposts with few trees, but by
around 3000 BC they were home to a thriving culture of farmers and
seafaring traders, and their inhabitants began to use local stone to
create not only the famous Cycladic figurines of musicians, but also
fortified towns and burial mounds. Several of these islands have
quarries of the beautiful white marble that later became the preferred
building material in Ancient Greece. To date, however, no habitations
have been excavated on these islands. 
Also from around 3000 BC, another Bronze Age culture thrived on
the much larger island of Crete, located in the southern area of the
Aegean, and this island culture developed into what was later called
the Minoan civilization. Minoan peoples are named after their leg-
endary ruler, King Minos, who is described in Homer’s epic tales as
ruling from his labyrinth-like palace in the ancient city of Knossos.
This palace, dating from 1900 BC to around 1100 BC, was discov-
ered by the archaeologists Heinrich Schliemann, who located the site,
and then Arthur Evans, who subsequently discovered and excavated
the area. Both scholars argued that Homer’s tales were not entirely
fictional, but could be used to unearth pre-Homeric cities such as the
ancient site of Troy in Turkey and the Peloponnesian city of the an-
cient ruling family of Atreus, known as Mycenae.
Minoan peoples farmed and maintained herds of animals, but they
also fished for food and established vast trade routes across the
Aegean and the Mediterranean. This thriving culture is also known
for its own system of writing, which was needed in order to keep</h2><br />
                        ARSITEKTUR ARUS KUNO ANEKA. Sebelum fajar An- cient Greece, sebuah masyarakat Neolitik yang dinamis dan kemudian Perunggu berkembang dengan pesat dalam beberapa budaya berbeda yang ditemukan di sepanjang Laut Aegea. Laut Aegea adalah rumah bagi banyak kelompok pulau, dan budaya Aegean paling awal dikenal, yang didirikan sekitar tahun 6000 SM, berpusat di beberapa Kepulauan Cycladic di lepas pantai tenggara Yunani. Saat ini daratan ini tampak cukup tandus, pos terdepan berbatu dengan beberapa pohon, namun sekitar 3000 SM, mereka merupakan rumah bagi budaya petani dan pedagang pelaut yang berkembang pesat, dan penduduk mereka mulai menggunakan batu lokal untuk menciptakan tidak hanya Cycladic yang terkenal. patung-patung pemusik, tapi juga benteng kota dan gundukan pemakaman. Beberapa pulau ini memiliki tambang marmer putih yang indah yang kemudian menjadi bahan bangunan pilihan di Yunani Kuno. Sampai saat ini, bagaimanapun, tidak ada habitat yang telah digali di pulau-pulau ini. Juga dari sekitar 3000 SM, budaya Zaman Perunggu lainnya tumbuh subur di pulau Kreta yang jauh lebih besar, terletak di wilayah selatan Laut Aegea, dan budaya pulau ini berkembang menjadi apa yang kemudian disebut peradaban Minoan. Orang-orang Minoa diberi nama menurut penguasa legendaris mereka, Raja Minos, yang digambarkan dalam cerita epik Homer yang memerintah dari istana mirip labirin di kota kuno Knossos. Istana ini, yang berasal dari tahun 1900 SM sampai sekitar tahun 1100 SM, ditemukan oleh para arkeolog Heinrich Schliemann, yang berada di lokasi tersebut, dan kemudian Arthur Evans, yang kemudian menemukan dan menggali daerah tersebut. Kedua ilmuwan tersebut berpendapat bahwa kisah Homer tidak sepenuhnya fiktif, namun dapat digunakan untuk menggali kota pra-Homer seperti situs kuno Troy di Turki dan kota peloponnesia di keluarga penguasa Atreus yang dikenal sebagai Mycenae. Masyarakat Minoan memelihara dan memelihara kawanan hewan, namun mereka juga mencari makanan dan mendirikan jalur perdagangan yang luas melintasi Laut Aegea dan Laut Tengah. Budaya yang berkembang ini juga dikenal dengan sistem penulisannya sendiri, yang dibutuhkan agar tetap terjaga<br />Semoga Bermanfaat <br />

                            11. Paul Bunyan is perhaps America’s best-known folk hero. A fictional logger of incredible strength, he was most likely based on an actual nineteenth-century logger from the northern United States or Canada. As a folk hero, he struck a chord with Americans on some level, perhaps because he was incredibly strong but also because he was hard-working and capable, ingenious in solving problems, and fun-loving.  Though there is evidence that Paul Bunyan tales were part of oral tradition in the nineteenth century, Paul Bunyan stories did not appear in written form until the early twentieth century. Journalist James McGillivray included descriptions of Bunyan in a series of essays entitled "The Round River Drive," which appeared in a number of Midwestern newspapers between 1906 and 1910.  However, it was through an extensive advertising campaign that Paul Bunyan moved solidly into print.  Recognizing the appeal of Paul Bunyan as a figure for his company’s advertising, William Laughead, an advertising executive for the Red River Lumber Company, initiated a campaign that consisted of a series of publications featuring Paul Bunyan. For several decades, the company distributed these publications free of charge and made no attempt to obtain a copyright on them. In fact, the company vigorously encouraged other writers to make use of Paul Bunyan because it felt that the use of this character enhanced the name recognition of the Red River Lumber Company inasmuch as the name of the folk hero and the name of the company had become interwoven.  The Bunyan stories published by Red River and further circulated by others were tall tales of gigantic proportions. In these tales, Bunyan is depicted as a man of superhuman proportions, who is strong, hard-working, entrepreneurial, and innovative. In one story, for example, Paul is credited with digging the Great Lakes in order to create a watering hole for his giant ox, Babe. In another of these tales, Paul caused an entire winter of blue snow to fall by swearing a blue streak after he injured himself by smashing his thumb with a large hammer. A third story in the series describes Paul’s role in establishing the Mississippi River.  Fascination with Paul Bunyan has continued to grow, and today he is a standard of American folklore. The prevalence of Bunyan as a figure of folklore today is evidenced by references to him in countless stories, cartoons, poems, and songs as well as the numerous community festivals and logging competitions featuring Paul Bunyan that can be found throughout the sections of the country where logging has a strong tradition.

                            12. Social media has come a long way in recent years. From 2006 onwards, the growth rate was unexpectedly high. As technology grows, despite its drawbacks, it is clear that more and more people will benefit from using social media. Here are some reasons why social media brings many benefits to society.The first and foremost advantage of social media is connectivity. People from anywhere can connect with anyone, regardless of location and religion. The beauty of social media is that you can connect with itanyone to learn and share your thoughts.Besides, social media has a lot of benefits for students and teachers. It's very easy to educate from other experts and professionals via social media. You can follow anyone to learn from it and increase your knowledge of any field. Regardless of your location and educational background, you caneducate yourself, without paying for it.Then, another advantage of the social media is that you can update yourself from the latest happenings around the world. With the help of social media, you can get the facts and true information by doing someresearch. However, we should be wise in receiving messages. In a few cases, messages we receivea are biased.Since our word has different religions and beliefs, social media helps in buiding and participating in the community of own religion and believes. Similarly, people of different communities can connect to discuss and share related items. For example, game lovers can join games-related communiues, car lovers can join communities related to cars, and so on.Last but not least, whether you have an offline or online business, you can promote your business to the largest audience. The whole word is open for you, to promote your business. This makes the business profitable and less expensive, because most of the expenses made over a business are for advertising and promotion. This can be decreased by constantly and regularly involving on the social media to connect with the right audience.Based on the arguments above, I believe that social media is beneficial for our lives. Howevey weshould be wise when using social media.Question:1. Is the text fictional or non-fiction? Explain the reason.2. Why is the text written?3. What tense is mostly used in the text4.

ANCIENT AEGEAN ARCHITECTURE. Before the dawn of An-
cient Greece, a vibrant Neolithic and then Bronze Age society thrived
in several different cultures found along the Aegean Sea. The Aegean
is home to many clusters of islands, and the earliest known Aegean
culture, established around 6000 BC, was centered on several of the
Cycladic Islands off the southeast coast of Greece. Today these is-
lands appear to be quite barren, rocky outposts with few trees, but by
around 3000 BC they were home to a thriving culture of farmers and
seafaring traders, and their inhabitants began to use local stone to
create not only the famous Cycladic figurines of musicians, but also
fortified towns and burial mounds. Several of these islands have
quarries of the beautiful white marble that later became the preferred
building material in Ancient Greece. To date, however, no habitations
have been excavated on these islands. 
Also from around 3000 BC, another Bronze Age culture thrived on
the much larger island of Crete, located in the southern area of the
Aegean, and this island culture developed into what was later called
the Minoan civilization. Minoan peoples are named after their leg-
endary ruler, King Minos, who is described in Homer’s epic tales as
ruling from his labyrinth-like palace in the ancient city of Knossos.
This palace, dating from 1900 BC to around 1100 BC, was discov-
ered by the archaeologists Heinrich Schliemann, who located the site,
and then Arthur Evans, who subsequently discovered and excavated
the area. Both scholars argued that Homer’s tales were not entirely
fictional, but could be used to unearth pre-Homeric cities such as the
ancient site of Troy in Turkey and the Peloponnesian city of the an-
cient ruling family of Atreus, known as Mycenae.
Minoan peoples farmed and maintained herds of animals, but they
also fished for food and established vast trade routes across the
Aegean and the Mediterranean. This thriving culture is also known
for its own system of writing, which was needed in order to keep</h2><br />

Saat ini daratan ini tampak cukup tandus, pos terdepan berbatu dengan beberapa pohon, namun sekitar 3000 SM, mereka merupakan rumah bagi budaya petani dan pedagang pelaut yang berkembang pesat, dan penduduk mereka mulai menggunakan batu lokal untuk menciptakan tidak hanya Cycladic yang terkenal. patung-patung pemusik, tapi juga benteng kota dan gundukan pemakaman. Beberapa pulau ini memiliki tambang marmer putih yang indah yang kemudian menjadi bahan bangunan pilihan di Yunani Kuno. Sampai saat ini, bagaimanapun, tidak ada habitat yang telah digali di pulau-pulau ini. Juga dari sekitar 3000 SM, budaya Zaman Perunggu lainnya tumbuh subur di pulau Kreta yang jauh lebih besar, terletak di wilayah selatan Laut Aegea, dan budaya pulau ini berkembang menjadi apa yang kemudian disebut peradaban Minoan. Orang-orang Minoa diberi nama menurut penguasa legendaris mereka, Raja Minos, yang digambarkan dalam cerita epik Homer yang memerintah dari istana mirip labirin di kota kuno Knossos. Istana ini, yang berasal dari tahun 1900 SM sampai sekitar tahun 1100 SM, ditemukan oleh para arkeolog Heinrich Schliemann, yang berada di lokasi tersebut, dan kemudian Arthur Evans, yang kemudian menemukan dan menggali daerah tersebut. Kedua ilmuwan tersebut berpendapat bahwa kisah Homer tidak sepenuhnya fiktif, namun dapat digunakan untuk menggali kota pra-Homer seperti situs kuno Troy di Turki dan kota peloponnesia di keluarga penguasa Atreus yang dikenal sebagai Mycenae.

When robots are virtual software agents,they are usually referred to as bots.The word 'robot' was first used to denote a fictional humanold in a1920 play R.U.R. by the Czech writer, Karel Čapek but it was Karel'sbrother Josef Čapek who was the word's true Inventor. In an articlein the Czech journal Lidové noviny in 1933, he explained that he hadoriginally wanted to call the creatures featured in the play labori("workers", from Latin labor). However, he did not like the word,and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested "roboti".The word robota means literally "corvée", "serf labor", andfiguratively "drudgery" or "hard work" in Czech and also (moregeneral) "work", "labor" in many Slavic languages:In general robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and arenow used in different fields. They have replaced humans inperforming repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefernot to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations or whichtake place in extreme environments such as outer space or thebottom of the sea. For instance, robots can now be used in industry,as in car manufacturing, or they can be used in homes to do thehousework.

                            25. The Hobbit is a film series consisting of three epic fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, which expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material and characters written especially for the films. The films are subtitled An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).
The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch). The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur, and the pursuit of Azog and Bolg, who seek vengeance against Thorin and his ancestors.
The first film in the series premiered at the Embassy Theatre in Wellington, New Zealand on 28 November 2012. One hundred thousand people lined the red carpet on Courtenay Place, and the entire event was broadcast live on television in New Zealand and streamed over the Internet. The second film of the series premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California on 2 December 2013. The third and final film premiered at Leicester Square in London on 1 December 2014.

                            33. SNAKES Snakes are reptiles. They belong to the same group as lizards but form a sub group of their own. Snakes are not slimy. They are covered in scales which are just bumps on the skin. Their skin is hard and glossy to reduce friction as the snake slithers along the ground. Snakes often sun bake on the rocks in the warm weather. This is because snakes are cold blooded and they need the sun's warmth to heat their body up. Most snakes live in the country. Some type of snakes live in trees, some live in water but most live on the ground deserted rabbit burrows, in thick, long grass and in old logs. A snake's diet usually consists of frogs, lizards and mice and other snakes. The Anaconda can eat small crocodiles and even wild boars. Answer the questions! 1. What is the text about? 2.

                            38. tolong terjemahkan ke bahasa indonesia AUTHOR-ORIENTED APPROACHESIn the nineteenth century, before the major formalist-structuralisttheories of the twentieth century, biographical criticism evolvedand became a dominant movement. This author-orientedapproach established a direct link between the literary text and thebiography of the author. Dates, facts, and events in an author’s life arejuxtaposed with literary elements of his or her works in order to findaspects which connect the biography of the author with the text.Research into the milieu and education of the author is conducted andthen related to certain phenomena in the text. In addition, an author’slibrary can be examined in order to gain insight into the author’sbackground reading orlettersand diaries may be consulted for personalreflections. Autobiographies are obviously suitable for this kind of approach,which compares the fictional portrayal with the facts and figures fromthe author’s life. In many cases, autobiographical material enters thefictional text in codes. The American playwright Eugene O’Neill, forexample, used veiled autobiographical elements in his play Long Day’sJourney into Night (c. 1941; published 1956). Although the charactersand events in the play are supposedly fictional, they are based on realpeople and dramatize events from his family life.Author-centered approaches focus also on aspects which mighthave entered the text on a subconscious or involuntary level. The factthat Mary Shelley had a miscarriage during the period in which shewrote her novel Frankenstein (1818) can be related directly to the plot.According to the author-centered approaches, the central theme ofthe novel, the creation of an artificial human being, can be traced backto Mary Shelley’s intense psychological occupation with the issue ofbirth at the time. Many authors wish to keep their texts fictional andtheir private spheres intact and hence oppose these approaches. Forexample, the American author J.D.Salinger, who became famous withthe publication of his novel The Catcher in the Rye, has strictly refusedto make public any information about his private life over the lastdecades.Canonical authors in particular—those who are highly regarded inliterary criticism, like Shakespeare, Milton, or Joyce—often tend tobe mythologized. This leads to attempts to reconstruct the author’sspirit through his work. Phenomenological approaches assume thatthe author is present in his text in encoded form and that his spirit canbe revived by an intensive reading of his complete works.As the example from Mary Shelley’s life shows, many biographicalapproaches also tend to employ psychological explanations. This hasled to psychoanalytic literary criticism, a movement whichsometimes deals with the author, but primarily attempts to illuminategeneral psychological aspects in a text that do not necessarily relate tothe author exclusively. Under the influence of Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), psychoanalytic literary criticism expanded the study ofpsychological features beyond the author to cover a variety of intrinsictextual aspects. For instance, characters in a text can be analyzedpsychologically, as if they were real people. An example which hasoften been cited in this context is the mental state of Hamlet inShakespeare’s drama; psychoanalytic critics ask whether Hamlet ismad and, if so, from which psychological illness he is suffering. Sigmund Freud, too, borrowed from literary texts in hisexplanations of certain psychological phenomena. Some of his studies,among them the analysis of E.T.A.Hoffmann’s (1772–1822) story“The Sandman” (1817), rank among the classical interpretations ofliterary texts. In the second half of the twentieth century,psychoanalytic literary criticism regained momentum under theinfluence of the French analyst Jacques Lacan (1901–81), especially inthe Anglo-American world. The interest in psychological phenomenaindirectly abetted the spread of the so-called reader-centeredapproaches. Their focus on the reception of a text by a reader or onthe reading process can, therefore, be seen as investigations ofpsychological phenomena in the widest sense of the term.mohon ada yang bisa terjemahkan dengan bahasa sendiri..??yg mudah dipahami</h2><br />
                        PENDEKATAN AUTHOR-ORIENTED

Pada abad kesembilan belas, sebelum strukturalis formalis utama

Teori abad ke-20, kritik biografi berkembang

dan menjadi gerakan yang dominan. Penulis ini berorientasi

Pendekatan membangun hubungan langsung antara teks sastra dan

biografi penulis Tanggal, fakta, dan kejadian dalam kehidupan seorang penulis adalah

disandingkan dengan unsur sastra karya-karyanya untuk bisa ditemukan

aspek yang menghubungkan biografi penulis dengan teks.

Penelitian tentang lingkungan dan pendidikan penulis dilakukan dan

lalu berhubungan dengan fenomena tertentu dalam teks. Selain itu, seorang penulis

Perpustakaan dapat diperiksa untuk mendapatkan wawasan tentang penulis

bacaan membaca orletters dan buku harian dapat dikonsultasikan untuk keperluan pribadi

refleksi.

Autobiografi jelas cocok untuk pendekatan semacam ini,

yang membandingkan penggambaran fiksi dengan fakta dan figur dari

hidup penulis. Dalam banyak kasus, materi otobiografi masuk ke dalam

teks fiktif dalam kode Penulis drama Amerika Eugene O'Neill, untuk

Misalnya, menggunakan elemen otobiografi terselubung dalam permainannya Long Day's

Perjalanan ke Malam (1941; diterbitkan 1956). Meski karakternya
dan kejadian dalam drama tersebut dianggap fiktif, semuanya didasarkan pada kenyataan

orang dan mendramatisasi acara dari kehidupan keluarganya.

Pendekatan yang berpusat pada penulis juga berfokus pada aspek-aspek yang mungkin

telah memasuki teks di tingkat bawah sadar atau tidak sadar. Faktanya

bahwa Mary Shelley mengalami keguguran selama periode di mana dia

menulis novelnya Frankenstein (1818) bisa langsung berhubungan dengan plot.

Menurut pendekatan yang berpusat pada penulis, tema sentral dari

novel, penciptaan manusia buatan, dapat ditelusuri kembali

untuk pekerjaan psikologis Mary Shelley yang intens dengan masalah

kelahiran saat itu Banyak penulis ingin menyimpan teks mereka fiktif dan

lingkungan pribadi mereka utuh dan karenanya menentang pendekatan ini. Untuk

Contohnya, penulis Amerika J.D.Salinger, yang menjadi terkenal dengan

penerbitan novelnya The Catcher in the Rye, telah benar-benar ditolak

untuk mengumumkan informasi tentang kehidupan pribadinya semaksimal mungkin

dekade.

Penulis Canonical pada khususnya - mereka yang sangat dihormati

kritik sastra, seperti Shakespeare, Milton, atau Joyce-sering kali cenderung

menjadi mitos. Hal ini menyebabkan usaha merekonstruksi penulis

semangat melalui karyanya Pendekatan fenomenologis berasumsi itu

penulis hadir dalam teksnya dalam bentuk yang dikodekan dan bahwa rohnya dapat melakukannya

dihidupkan kembali dengan membaca secara intensif karya-karyanya yang lengkap.

Seperti contoh dari kehidupan Mary Shelley, banyak biografiPendekatan juga cenderung menggunakan penjelasan psikologis. Ini mempunyai
menyebabkan kritik sastra psikoanalitik, sebuah gerakan yang

Kadang-kadang berurusan dengan penulis, tapi terutama mencoba untuk menerangi

Aspek psikologis umum dalam teks yang tidak harus berhubungan dengan

penulis secara eksklusif Di bawah pengaruh Sigmund Freud (1856-

1939), kritik sastra psikoanalis memperluas studi tentang

Fitur psikologis diluar penulis mencakup berbagai intrinsik

aspek tekstual. Misalnya, karakter dalam teks bisa dianalisis

secara psikologis, seolah-olah mereka adalah orang sungguhan. Contoh yang ada

Sering dikutip dalam konteks ini adalah keadaan mental Hamlet di Indonesia

Drama Shakespeare; Kritik psikoanalisis menanyakan apakah Hamlet itu

gila dan, jika demikian, dari mana penyakit psikologis dia menderita.

Sigmund Freud juga meminjam teks-teks sastra di dalamnya

penjelasan fenomena psikologis tertentu. Beberapa studinya,

di antaranya analisis cerita E.T.A.Hoffmann (1772-1822)

"The Sandman" (1817), berada di antara interpretasi klasik teks-teks sastra. Pada paruh kedua abad ke-20,

kritik sastra psikoanalisis mendapatkan momentum di bawah

pengaruh analis Perancis Jacques Lacan (1901-81), terutama di Indonesia

dunia Anglo-Amerika. Minat terhadap fenomena psikologis

secara tidak langsung mendukung penyebaran apa yang disebut pembaca-berpusat

pendekatan. Fokus mereka pada penerimaan teks oleh pembaca atau pembaca

I surprised my Mom when she was cooking in the kitchen. I didn't tell her the day I would fly to Bengkulu. I missed her a lot that was why I hugged her for a minute. On the next day, my parents, my sisters and I went to church for Christmas Eve It was a moment which makes me always be thankful to God.On December 27th (two day after Christmas). I was invited by my old friends to join them in a sparring futsal match in the evening. I wasn't sure because I didn't feel good at the time. I had a common cold and influenza that needed much rest. Unfortunately I couldn't refuse itIn the sparring match. I played well for the first 5 minutes. I felt okay before something unusual happened. I couldn't breathe normally and I felt my heart beat faster than before. Everything was just dark. I was unconscious and didn't feel anything. Luckily a few minutes later. I was conscious and heard people calling my name. I was still alive. By that terrible moment. I would never join a match when I am not physically good.
