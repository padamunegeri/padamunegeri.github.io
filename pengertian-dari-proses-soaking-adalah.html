Your friend, Kayla, posted an update on a social media:
“The rain was pouring down so hard this morning, when I did not bring my umbrella. I got soaking wet (all of my books got wet as well, including the report I wrote for five hours the day before). Two hours later at school, I fell from the stairs and sprained my ankle. Now, I’m just lying down in the infirmary and posting this, while the others are having fun in science class. Life can be so unfair".
Comments:
Dion: What a bad day you’re having! I hope your ankle will recover soon! Take care of yourself.
Kayla: Yeah, worst day so far. Thank you for your thought.
Silfa: It’s sad that your report got soaked  . I’m sure you put a lot of effort into that. Hope your teacher understands. Cheer up!
 Kayla: ….

Don’t tell me to cheer up because you don’t know how it feels.
3 
It’s not sad. It’s devastating. Don’t act like you know how I put a lot of effort into my report. I hate people like you. You know nothing about me.
4 
Fortunately, I have a copy of my report at home, and my teacher understands my condition quite well. So, it’s not a problem now. Thanks, anyway. I’ll try to cheer myself up.

Fortunately, my parents picked me up at school, and my teacher understands my condition quite well. Thank you for your support</a>

One day, I was called for a meeting. All teachers and my friends were
scowling at me. The teachers even punished me and asked me to stand on a
chair with my eyes closed in the middle of the school yard. I was crying. I didn't.
know why they did it to me.
Then suddenly, I heard my teachers and friends sang" Happy Birthday".
After that, they showered me with water until I was soaking wet. And then they
congratulated me and gave me presents.
I was very surprised. I'll never forget that moment.

       What is tempe? Tempe is a kind of food made of fermented soybean. It is the most popular food in Indonesia. It is practice, delicious, nutritious, and good for our health. Tempe contains some nutrition such as amino acid, omega 3 and omega 6, vitamin B, mineral, protein, and other antioxidants.
       Tempe may be made from soybeans, wheat, or may include a mixture of soybeans and whole grains. In Indonesia, it is usual to use soybeans to make tempe. Tempe begins with whole soybeans, which are softened by soaking and hulling, then partly cooked. This is needed to make the soybeans absorb water and the acid in soaking process and also help mycelium fungi penetrate the beans.
       A mild acidulent, usually vinegar, may be added in order to lower the pH and create a selective environment that favours the growth of the tempeh mould over competitors. A fermentation starter containing the spores of fungus Rhizopus oligosporus is mixed in. The beans are spread into a thin layer and are allowed to ferment for 24 to 36 hours at a temperature around 30°C (86°F). In good tempe, the beans are knitted together by a mat of white mycelia.
       Under conditions of lower temperature, or higher ventilation, grey or black patches of spores may form on the surface—this is not harmful, and should not affect the flavour or quality of the tempe. This sporulation is normal on fully mature tempe. A mild ammonia smell may accompany good tempe as it ferments, but it should not be overpowering. In Indonesia, ripe tempe (two or more days old) is considered a delicacy.</a>

It was almost 6:30 p.m. when the residents in the area heard a "big bang" on the Joseph River bridge. A man whose cottage was near the crash site ran outside in a panic to see what had happened. What he saw there was a young woman standing, soaking wet, on the shoulder of the road, on the opposite side of a peeled-back and twisted guardrail, near the bridge, appearing to be in total shock. A pine tree behind her had been split in half and, below the bridge, was an Audi in the Joseph River with three male victims still inside.1.What does the paragraph mostly describe about? 2.

                                            A long time ago, in Singapore, there was a Sultan who lived with his villagers harmonious and peace. His villagers plied trade for supplying their daily needs.However, one day, the southern coast of Singapore was infested by numerous fierce swordfish. The villagers and fishermen could not ply their trades at the sea, as they would be attacked by these fearsome creatures if they ever ventured near the waters. One day, the people requested help from the Sultan, but even he and his royal army could not do anything about it.A little boy then proposed a solution to the Sultan. Build a row of barricade made of banana tree trunks along the affected coast, he said. When the swordfish tried to attack the villagers again, their pointed beaks would pierce through the barricade and would be trapped immediately.The plan worked perfectly, and the smart boy became popular among the villagers as their savior. This invited jealousy from the Sultan. Fearing his rule would be threatened in the future, he sent his soldiers to kill the boy who lived on top of a hill. As the poor boy died, his blood flew down the hill, soaking the whole hill red. This was how Redhill, or Bukit Merah got its name.What is the resolution of the conflict in text above?</a>

                                            1. The questions number 1-3 are based on the following passage. In the US, consumers spend around $700 million a year keeping their fabrics soft. In the UK people spend £200 million a year on fabric softener. A giant manufacturer even claims a massive 50 percent share of the market. Despite the popularity, fabric softeners can be harmful to both the people who use them and the marine life that ends up swimming in them. Fabric softening surfactants can be derived from animals, plants or minerals, as in the case of newer, silicone-based formulations. There is little difference between the chemicals used in fabric softeners and those used in hair conditioners. Whatever they are based on, all fabric softeners work in pretty much the same way, by depositing these surfactants onto the fabric to make it feel softer, reduce static cling, and impart a fresh fragrance. Special fixatives in the mix of both standard and luxury conditioners mean that the fragrance can last for days, permeating wardrobes and drawers. The regular off-gassing of perfume chemicals from fabric softeners can be a significant trigger for asthma and other breathing problems. In the US, chemically sensitive individuals complain that, even after several washes, they cannot get the smell of fabric softeners out of their washing machines and dryers. If you are a fabric softener addict, there are now a number of companies that provide alternative and 'green' fabric softeners. However, essentially, these are unnecessary products that can trigger health problems and can interfere with the functional aspect of some textiles. For instance, when used on towels and nappies, some fabric softeners can reduce absorbency, which is why it's generally recommended that reusable nappies aren't washed with them. Once they are washed down the drain they can become highly toxic to aquatic life. Given this, maybe it's worth asking yourself whether the time has come to break the fabric softener habit completely. What does the passage mainly talk about? A. The downside of fabric softener usage B. The popularity of fabric softener in the US C. Harmful compounds found in fabric softener D. Controlling the habit of using fabric softener E. Environmental issues caused by fabric softener 2. The word permeating in the third paragraph is similar in meaning with d. attaining A. Filling b. soaking c. charging e. absorbing ... 3. Based on the passage, it can be hypothesized that A. 'Green' softeners are developed in response to the needs of fabric softener addicts. B. Manufactures will shift to producing 'green' fabric softener products. C. A small amount of fabric softener chemicals in the water will not harm aquatic life. D. The absorbency in some textiles will be reduced if they are washed with fabric softeners. E. People with breathing problems will feel safer using fabric softener if it contains fewer perfume chemicals.​</a>

This lets us enjoy the gorgeous sunset by the lakes. Hang out by the lake; we can take photos until 9.30 pm because there still be light.

One day, I was called for a meeting. All teachers and my friends were
scowling at me. The teachers even punished me and asked me to stand on a
chair with my eyes closed in the middle of the school yard. I was crying. I didn't
know why they did it to me.
Then suddenly, I heard my teachers and friends sang" Happy Birthday".
After that, they showered me with water until I was soaking wet. And then they
congratulated me and gave me presents.
I was very surprised. I'll never forget that moment.

                                            A long time ago, in Singapore, there was a Sultan who lived with his villagers harmonious and peace. His villagers plied trade for supplying their daily needs.  However, one day, the southern coast of Singapore was infested by numerous fierce swordfish. The villagers and fishermen could not ply their trades at the sea, as they would be attacked by these fearsome creatures if they ever ventured near the waters. One day, the people requested help from the Sultan, but even he and his royal army could not do anything about it.  A little boy then proposed a solution to the Sultan. Build a row of barricade made of banana tree trunks along the affected coast, he said. When the swordfish tried to attack the villagers again, their pointed beaks would pierce through the barricade and would be trapped immediately.  The plan worked perfectly, and the smart boy became popular among the villagers as their savior. This invited jealousy from the Sultan. Fearing his rule would be threatened in the future, he sent his soldiers to kill the boy who lived on top of a hill. As the poor boy died, his blood flew down the hill, soaking the whole hill red. This was how Redhill, or Bukit Merah got its name. What is the conflict of the story above?</a>

Your friend, Kayla, posted an update on a social media:
“The rain was pouring down so hard this morning, when I did not bring my umbrella. I got soaking wet (all of my books got wet as well, including the report I wrote for five hours the day before). Two hours later at school, I fell from the stairs and sprained my ankle. Now, I’m just lying down in the infirmary and posting this, while the others are having fun in science class. Life can be so unfair".
Comments:
Dion: What a bad day you’re having! I hope your ankle will recover soon! Take care of yourself.
Kayla: Yeah, worst day so far. Thank you for your thought.
Silfa: It’s sad that your report got soaked  . I’m sure you put a lot of effort into that. Hope your teacher understands. Cheer up!
 Kayla: ….

Yes, it is. I hope you understand.

Don’t tell me to cheer up because you don’t know how it feels.
3 
It’s not sad. It’s devastating. Don’t act like you know how I put a lot of effort into my report. I hate people like you. You know nothing about me.
4 
Fortunately, I have a copy of my report at home, and my teacher understands my condition quite well. So, it’s not a problem now. Thanks, anyway. I’ll try to cheer myself up.

       What is tempe? Tempe is a kind of food made of fermented soybean. It is the most popular food in Indonesia. It is practice, delicious, nutritious, and good for our health. Tempe contains some nutrition such as amino acid, omega 3 and omega 6, vitamin B, mineral, protein, and other antioxidants.
       Tempe may be made from soybeans, wheat, or may include a mixture of soybeans and whole grains. In Indonesia, it is usual to use soybeans to make tempe. Tempe begins with whole soybeans, which are softened by soaking and hulling, then partly cooked. This is needed to make the soybeans absorb water and the acid in soaking process and also help mycelium fungi penetrate the beans.
       A mild acidulent, usually vinegar, may be added in order to lower the pH and create a selective environment that favours the growth of the tempeh mould over competitors. A fermentation starter containing the spores of fungus Rhizopus oligosporus is mixed in. The beans are spread into a thin layer and are allowed to ferment for 24 to 36 hours at a temperature around 30°C (86°F). In good tempe, the beans are knitted together by a mat of white mycelia.
       Under conditions of lower temperature, or higher ventilation, grey or black patches of spores may form on the surface—this is not harmful, and should not affect the flavour or quality of the tempe. This sporulation is normal on fully mature tempe. A mild ammonia smell may accompany good tempe as it ferments, but it should not be overpowering. In Indonesia, ripe tempe (two or more days old) is considered a delicacy.</h2><br />

The beans are spread into a thin layer and are allowed to ferment for 24 to 36 hours at a temperature around 30°C (86°F). In good tempe, the beans are knitted together by a mat of white mycelia.
</p><p><strong>Closing</strong></p><p>Under conditions of lower temperature, or higher ventilation, grey or black patches of spores may form on the surface—this is not harmful, and should not affect the flavour or quality of the tempe. This sporulation is normal on fully mature tempe. A mild ammonia smell may accompany good tempe as it ferments, but it should not be overpowering. In Indonesia, ripe tempe (two or more days old) is considered a delicacy.</p><p><strong>PEMBAHASAN:</strong></p><p><strong>Explanation Text

                            18. The car burst through the metal guardrail, as if the guardrail had been made of cardboard, and struck a tree before smashing down the embankment and rolling to a stop, on its side, in the river. It was almost 6:30 p.m. when the residents in the area heard a "big bang" on the Joseph River bridge. A man whose cottage was near the crash site ran outside in a panic to see what had happened. What he saw there was a young woman standing, soaking wet, on the shoulder of the road, on the opposite side of a peeled-back and twisted guardrail, near the bridge, appearing to be in total shock. A pine tree behind her had been split in half and, below the bridge, was an Audi in the Joseph River with three male victims still inside.1.What does the paragraph mostly describe about? 2.

                            19. A long time ago, in Singapore, there was a Sultan who lived with his villagers harmonious and peace. His villagers plied trade for supplying their daily needs.However, one day, the southern coast of Singapore was infested by numerous fierce swordfish. The villagers and fishermen could not ply their trades at the sea, as they would be attacked by these fearsome creatures if they ever ventured near the waters. One day, the people requested help from the Sultan, but even he and his royal army could not do anything about it.A little boy then proposed a solution to the Sultan. Build a row of barricade made of banana tree trunks along the affected coast, he said. When the swordfish tried to attack the villagers again, their pointed beaks would pierce through the barricade and would be trapped immediately.The plan worked perfectly, and the smart boy became popular among the villagers as their savior. This invited jealousy from the Sultan. Fearing his rule would be threatened in the future, he sent his soldiers to kill the boy who lived on top of a hill. As the poor boy died, his blood flew down the hill, soaking the whole hill red. This was how Redhill, or Bukit Merah got its name.What is the resolution of the conflict in text above?</h2><br />

                            30. 1. The questions number 1-3 are based on the following passage. In the US, consumers spend around $700 million a year keeping their fabrics soft. In the UK people spend £200 million a year on fabric softener. A giant manufacturer even claims a massive 50 percent share of the market. Despite the popularity, fabric softeners can be harmful to both the people who use them and the marine life that ends up swimming in them. Fabric softening surfactants can be derived from animals, plants or minerals, as in the case of newer, silicone-based formulations. There is little difference between the chemicals used in fabric softeners and those used in hair conditioners. Whatever they are based on, all fabric softeners work in pretty much the same way, by depositing these surfactants onto the fabric to make it feel softer, reduce static cling, and impart a fresh fragrance. Special fixatives in the mix of both standard and luxury conditioners mean that the fragrance can last for days, permeating wardrobes and drawers. The regular off-gassing of perfume chemicals from fabric softeners can be a significant trigger for asthma and other breathing problems. In the US, chemically sensitive individuals complain that, even after several washes, they cannot get the smell of fabric softeners out of their washing machines and dryers. If you are a fabric softener addict, there are now a number of companies that provide alternative and 'green' fabric softeners. However, essentially, these are unnecessary products that can trigger health problems and can interfere with the functional aspect of some textiles. For instance, when used on towels and nappies, some fabric softeners can reduce absorbency, which is why it's generally recommended that reusable nappies aren't washed with them. Once they are washed down the drain they can become highly toxic to aquatic life. Given this, maybe it's worth asking yourself whether the time has come to break the fabric softener habit completely. What does the passage mainly talk about? A. The downside of fabric softener usage B. The popularity of fabric softener in the US C. Harmful compounds found in fabric softener D. Controlling the habit of using fabric softener E. Environmental issues caused by fabric softener 2. The word permeating in the third paragraph is similar in meaning with d. attaining A.

Manufactures will shift to producing 'green' fabric softener products. C. A small amount of fabric softener chemicals in the water will not harm aquatic life. D. The absorbency in some textiles will be reduced if they are washed with fabric softeners. E. People with breathing problems will feel safer using fabric softener if it contains fewer perfume chemicals.​</h2><br />

It usually lasts until early October. Everyone is soaking up the outdoors, nature and beauty that the malls are empty. The sun goes down so late in Seattle in summers.

                            32. I had one unforgettable experience. It happened when I was in high school.
One day, I was called for a meeting. All teachers and my friends were
scowling at me. The teachers even punished me and asked me to stand on a
chair with my eyes closed in the middle of the school yard. I was crying. I didn't
know why they did it to me.
Then suddenly, I heard my teachers and friends sang" Happy Birthday".
After that, they showered me with water until I was soaking wet. And then they
congratulated me and gave me presents.
I was very surprised. I'll never forget that moment.

                            33. A long time ago, in Singapore, there was a Sultan who lived with his villagers harmonious and peace. His villagers plied trade for supplying their daily needs.  However, one day, the southern coast of Singapore was infested by numerous fierce swordfish. The villagers and fishermen could not ply their trades at the sea, as they would be attacked by these fearsome creatures if they ever ventured near the waters. One day, the people requested help from the Sultan, but even he and his royal army could not do anything about it.  A little boy then proposed a solution to the Sultan. Build a row of barricade made of banana tree trunks along the affected coast, he said. When the swordfish tried to attack the villagers again, their pointed beaks would pierce through the barricade and would be trapped immediately.  The plan worked perfectly, and the smart boy became popular among the villagers as their savior. This invited jealousy from the Sultan. Fearing his rule would be threatened in the future, he sent his soldiers to kill the boy who lived on top of a hill. As the poor boy died, his blood flew down the hill, soaking the whole hill red. This was how Redhill, or Bukit Merah got its name. What is the conflict of the story above?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>the conflict is when the boy popular and then sultan jealous to him</p><br />
